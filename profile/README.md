# Welcome to JeoparDIZe

At **JeoparDIZe**, we are pioneering the next generation of **Cognitive Operations** — a new class of AI systems designed to understand how organizations think, work, and make decisions.  
Our mission is to build intelligent co-mentors that reflect team behavior, reduce coordination debt, and empower people to operate at their highest level.

## What We Build

Our contributions bridge the gap between organizational psychology, cognitive modeling, and applied machine learning.  
We focus on creating tools that help teams gain clarity, context, and cognitive alignment.

Our work includes:

- **The Jeopar Cognitive Reflection Engine**  
  A multimodal AI system that models team behavior, decision patterns, and workflow signals to generate reflective insights.

- **Dynamic Dashboards & Behavioral Analytics**  
  Adaptive interfaces that visualize cognitive states, focus areas, and improvement paths personalized for each role.

- **J² Mentor**  
  A role-aware AI co-pilot trained from team behavior, capable of providing guidance, summaries, and cognitive suggestions.

- **J² Pulse**  
  A lightweight audio/video generator that delivers daily “JeoNews” briefings — like a personal business reporter for your team.

- **Learning Loop Frameworks**  
  Tools that process user interactions, feedback, and team performance to continuously refine mentor models.
